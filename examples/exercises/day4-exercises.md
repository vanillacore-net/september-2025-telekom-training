## Exercise 1: Enterprise Integration Platform Architecture üè¢
**Pattern Focus:** Multi-Pattern Integration | **Duration:** 40 minutes | **Type:** Architectural Design

### Scenario
Telekom needs to build a comprehensive Customer Data Platform that integrates data from multiple sources (CRM, billing, network monitoring, customer service), processes it in real-time, and provides unified APIs for various consumer applications (mobile apps, web portals, analytics dashboards, AI services).

### System Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
- **Data Integration:** Connect to 15+ legacy systems with different interfaces and data formats
- **Real-time Processing:** Process customer events in real-time (< 100ms latency)
- **Data Transformation:** Convert between different data formats and schemas
- **API Management:** Provide consistent APIs for 20+ consumer applications
- **Event Streaming:** Support event-driven architecture with reliable message delivery
- **Configuration Management:** Dynamic configuration for different environments and regions

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability:** Handle 10M+ customer records, 1M+ events per hour
- **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime with automatic failover
- **Security:** End-to-end encryption, role-based access control
- **Performance:** Sub-second response times for API calls
- **Maintainability:** Easy to modify and extend individual components

### Part A: Architecture Design (25 minutes)

#### Task 1: Pattern Selection and Justification (10 minutes)
Analyze the requirements and select appropriate design patterns. For each pattern, provide justification based on the requirements.

**Available Patterns:**
- **Creational:** Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, Singleton
- **Structural:** Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy
- **Behavioral:** Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor

**Pattern Selection Framework:**
```
Pattern: [Pattern Name]
Component: [System Component Where Applied]
Justification: [Why This Pattern Solves the Specific Problem]
Trade-offs: [Benefits vs. Complexity]
Integration: [How It Works with Other Patterns]
```

#### Task 2: System Architecture Design (15 minutes)
Design the overall system architecture showing how the selected patterns work together.

**Architecture Components to Design:**

```java
// Data Source Integration Layer
public interface DataSourceAdapter {
    // Adapter pattern for legacy system integration
}

public abstract class DataSourceFactory {
    // Factory Method for creating data source connections
}

// Data Processing Pipeline
public class DataProcessingPipeline {
    // Chain of Responsibility for processing steps
    // Template Method for standard processing workflow
}

// Event Processing System
public interface EventProcessor {
    // Observer pattern for event handling
    // Strategy pattern for different processing strategies
}

// API Gateway
public class APIGateway {
    // Facade pattern for simplified API access
    // Proxy pattern for security and caching
}

// Configuration Management
public class ConfigurationManager {
    // Singleton for global configuration
    // Builder for complex configuration objects
}

// System Orchestrator
public class CustomerDataPlatform {
    // Mediator pattern for component coordination
    // Command pattern for operation logging
}
```

**Required Deliverables:**
1. **System diagram** showing pattern relationships
2. **Key interface definitions** (3-5 interfaces)
3. **Pattern interaction description** (how patterns collaborate)
4. **Failure handling strategy** (how patterns support resilience)

### Part B: Critical Component Implementation (15 minutes)

Choose ONE of the following components and implement it with proper pattern application:

#### Option 1: Data Processing Pipeline with Chain of Responsibility + Template Method
```java
public abstract class DataProcessingHandler {
    protected DataProcessingHandler next;
    
    public void setNext(DataProcessingHandler handler) {
        this.next = handler;
    }
    
    // Template method defining processing structure
    public final ProcessingResult process(CustomerData data) {
        if (canProcess(data)) {
            ProcessingResult result = doProcess(data);
            if (result.shouldContinue() && next != null) {
                return next.process(data);
            }
            return result;
        } else if (next != null) {
            return next.process(data);
        }
        return ProcessingResult.unhandled();
    }
    
    protected abstract boolean canProcess(CustomerData data);
    protected abstract ProcessingResult doProcess(CustomerData data);
}

// Implement handlers for: DataValidation, DataEnrichment, DataTransformation, DataPersistence
```

#### Option 2: Event Processing System with Observer + Strategy
```java
public interface EventProcessingStrategy {
    void processEvent(CustomerEvent event, ProcessingContext context);
    boolean canHandle(CustomerEvent event);
    ProcessingPriority getPriority();
}

public class CustomerEventProcessor implements EventSubject {
    private List<EventObserver> observers = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
    private Map<EventType, EventProcessingStrategy> strategies = new HashMap<>();
    
    // Implement observer pattern for event notification
    // Implement strategy selection for event processing
    
    public void processCustomerEvent(CustomerEvent event) {
        // TODO: Select strategy, process event, notify observers
    }
}
```

#### Option 3: API Gateway with Facade + Proxy + Decorator
```java
public interface CustomerDataAPI {
    CustomerProfile getCustomerProfile(String customerId);
    List<ServiceContract> getCustomerContracts(String customerId);
    BillingHistory getBillingHistory(String customerId);
    List<SupportTicket> getSupportTickets(String customerId);
}

public class CustomerDataAPIGateway implements CustomerDataAPI {
    // Facade - simplifies access to multiple backend systems
    // Proxy - adds security, caching, logging
    // Decorator - adds monitoring, rate limiting, transformation
}
```

## Exercise 2: Legacy Modernization Strategy üîÑ
**Pattern Focus:** Architectural Refactoring | **Duration:** 35 minutes | **Type:** Migration Design

### Scenario
Telekom has a 15-year-old Customer Management System built as a monolith with 500,000+ lines of code. The system handles customer registration, service activation, billing, and support ticketing. It needs to be modernized to support cloud deployment, microservices architecture, and real-time processing.

### Current System Problems
```java
// Typical legacy code structure
public class CustomerManagementSystem {
    
    // God class handling everything
    public void processCustomerRequest(CustomerRequest request) {
        // 200+ line method with multiple responsibilities
        
        if (request.getType() == RequestType.REGISTRATION) {
            // Customer registration logic - 50 lines
            Customer customer = new Customer();
            // ... database operations
            // ... validation logic  
            // ... notification logic
            // ... billing setup
            // ... service activation
            
        } else if (request.getType() == RequestType.SERVICE_CHANGE) {
            // Service change logic - 80 lines
            // ... complex conditional logic
            // ... direct database manipulation
            // ... hardcoded business rules
            
        } else if (request.getType() == RequestType.BILLING_INQUIRY) {
            // Billing logic - 70 lines
            // ... more complex conditionals
            // ... legacy system integration
        }
        // ... more if-else blocks
    }
    
    // Tight coupling to database
    public void saveCustomer(Customer customer) {
        // Direct JDBC calls mixed with business logic
        Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, USER, PASS);
        // ... SQL queries embedded in business code
    }
    
    // No abstraction layers
    public void sendNotification(String customerId, String message) {
        // Direct integration with email/SMS services
        // Hardcoded service endpoints and credentials
    }
}
```

### Part A: Migration Strategy Design (15 minutes)

Design a pattern-based modernization strategy that allows gradual migration from monolith to microservices.

#### Task 1: Identify Refactoring Opportunities (5 minutes)
For each code smell, identify which design patterns could help:

- **God Class:** Which patterns break down large classes?
- **Long Methods:** How to extract and organize complex logic?
- **Tight Coupling:** Which patterns introduce proper abstractions?
- **Hardcoded Dependencies:** How to make the system more flexible?
- **Mixed Responsibilities:** How to separate concerns properly?

#### Task 2: Strangler Fig Pattern Implementation (10 minutes)
Design a "Strangler Fig" migration approach that gradually replaces legacy functionality.

```java
// Step 1: Create abstraction layer
public interface CustomerService {
    CustomerResult processRegistration(RegistrationRequest request);
    CustomerResult processServiceChange(ServiceChangeRequest request);
    CustomerResult processBillingInquiry(BillingInquiryRequest request);
}

// Step 2: Wrap legacy system
public class LegacyCustomerServiceAdapter implements CustomerService {
    private CustomerManagementSystem legacySystem;
    
    @Override
    public CustomerResult processRegistration(RegistrationRequest request) {
        // Adapt new interface to legacy implementation
        CustomerRequest legacyRequest = convertToLegacyFormat(request);
        legacySystem.processCustomerRequest(legacyRequest);
        return convertFromLegacyFormat(/* legacy response */);
    }
    
    // TODO: Implement other methods
}

// Step 3: Create modern implementation
public class ModernCustomerService implements CustomerService {
    private CustomerRegistrationService registrationService;
    private ServiceChangeService serviceChangeService;
    private BillingInquiryService billingService;
    
    // TODO: Implement using modern patterns and microservice calls
}

// Step 4: Route requests based on migration progress
public class CustomerServiceProxy implements CustomerService {
    private CustomerService legacyService;
    private CustomerService modernService;
    private MigrationConfiguration migrationConfig;
    
    @Override
    public CustomerResult processRegistration(RegistrationRequest request) {
        if (migrationConfig.isRegistrationMigrated()) {
            return modernService.processRegistration(request);
        } else {
            return legacyService.processRegistration(request);
        }
    }
    
    // TODO: Implement routing logic for gradual migration
}
```

### Part B: Microservice Extraction Design (20 minutes)

#### Task 1: Service Boundary Identification (8 minutes)
Using Domain-Driven Design principles, identify service boundaries and design patterns for each service.

**Proposed Microservices:**
- **Customer Registration Service**
- **Service Management Service**  
- **Billing Service**
- **Notification Service**
- **Support Ticket Service**

For each service, specify:
```
Service: [Service Name]
Responsibilities: [What it does]
Patterns Used: [Which patterns apply]
Integration: [How it communicates with other services]
Data Model: [Key entities]
```

#### Task 2: Service Communication Patterns (12 minutes)
Design the communication patterns between microservices.

```java
// Event-driven communication using Observer pattern
public interface DomainEvent {
    String getEventId();
    LocalDateTime getTimestamp();
    String getEventType();
}

public class CustomerRegisteredEvent implements DomainEvent {
    private String customerId;
    private CustomerProfile profile;
    private LocalDateTime registrationTime;
    
    // TODO: Implementation
}

// Service communication using Message Patterns
public interface EventBus {
    void publish(DomainEvent event);
    void subscribe(String eventType, EventHandler handler);
}

public class CustomerRegistrationService {
    private EventBus eventBus;
    
    public CustomerResult registerCustomer(RegistrationRequest request) {
        // Process registration
        CustomerProfile profile = processRegistration(request);
        
        // Publish event for other services
        CustomerRegisteredEvent event = new CustomerRegisteredEvent(
            profile.getCustomerId(), profile, LocalDateTime.now());
        eventBus.publish(event);
        
        return CustomerResult.success(profile);
    }
}

// Other services react to events
public class BillingService implements EventHandler {
    @Override
    public void handle(DomainEvent event) {
        if (event instanceof CustomerRegisteredEvent) {
            CustomerRegisteredEvent customerEvent = (CustomerRegisteredEvent) event;
            setupCustomerBilling(customerEvent.getCustomerId());
        }
    }
}
```

**Communication Pattern Requirements:**
- **Synchronous:** RESTful APIs for real-time queries
- **Asynchronous:** Event streaming for data consistency
- **Resilience:** Circuit breaker pattern for failure handling
- **Security:** OAuth 2.0 with role-based access control

## Exercise 3: Scalability and Performance Optimization üöÄ
**Pattern Focus:** Performance Patterns | **Duration:** 30 minutes | **Type:** Optimization Challenge

### Scenario
The modernized Telekom Customer Data Platform is experiencing performance issues under high load (peak traffic: 50,000 concurrent users, 100,000 API calls per minute). You need to apply design patterns to optimize performance while maintaining system integrity.

### Performance Challenges

#### Challenge 1: Database Connection Management (10 minutes)
The system creates new database connections for each request, causing connection pool exhaustion.

**Current Problem:**
```java
public class CustomerDataRepository {
    public Customer findCustomer(String customerId) {
        // Anti-pattern: New connection per request
        Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, USER, PASS);
        PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id = ?");
        stmt.setString(1, customerId);
        ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();
        
        // Process results...
        
        conn.close(); // Connection not reused
        return customer;
    }
}
```

**Task:** Apply appropriate patterns to optimize database connectivity.

**Pattern Options:**
- **Object Pool Pattern** for connection management
- **Flyweight Pattern** for sharing database connections
- **Proxy Pattern** for connection caching and management

**Implementation:**
```java
// Choose and implement one of these approaches:

// Option 1: Object Pool Pattern
public class DatabaseConnectionPool {
    private Queue<Connection> availableConnections;
    private Set<Connection> usedConnections;
    private int maxPoolSize;
    
    public Connection acquireConnection() {
        // TODO: Implement connection acquisition
    }
    
    public void releaseConnection(Connection connection) {
        // TODO: Implement connection release
    }
}

// Option 2: Flyweight Pattern  
public class ConnectionFlyweight {
    private static Map<String, Connection> connections = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    
    public static Connection getConnection(String connectionString) {
        // TODO: Implement flyweight connection sharing
    }
}

// Option 3: Proxy Pattern
public class DatabaseConnectionProxy {
    private Connection realConnection;
    private ConnectionPool pool;
    
    public PreparedStatement prepareStatement(String sql) {
        // TODO: Implement lazy connection management
    }
}
```

#### Challenge 2: API Response Caching (10 minutes)
Frequently requested customer data is being fetched from database every time, causing unnecessary load.

**Requirements:**
- Cache customer profiles for 15 minutes
- Cache service contracts for 5 minutes
- Support cache invalidation on data updates
- Handle cache misses gracefully

**Task:** Design and implement a caching solution using design patterns.

```java
// Design a caching system using appropriate patterns
public interface CacheStrategy {
    <T> T get(String key, Class<T> type);
    void put(String key, Object value, Duration ttl);
    void invalidate(String key);
    void invalidatePattern(String pattern);
}

public class CustomerDataService {
    private CustomerDataRepository repository;
    private CacheStrategy cache;
    
    public CustomerProfile getCustomerProfile(String customerId) {
        // TODO: Implement caching logic
        // 1. Check cache first
        // 2. If miss, fetch from database
        // 3. Store in cache with appropriate TTL
        // 4. Return result
    }
    
    public void updateCustomerProfile(String customerId, CustomerProfile profile) {
        // TODO: Implement cache invalidation on updates
        // 1. Update database
        // 2. Invalidate cache entries
        // 3. Optionally warm cache with new data
    }
}
```

#### Challenge 3: Concurrent Request Processing (10 minutes)
The system struggles with concurrent updates to customer data, causing race conditions and inconsistent state.

**Task:** Apply concurrency patterns to handle concurrent access safely.

**Pattern Options:**
- **Command Pattern** with queuing for serialized execution
- **Observer Pattern** with event queuing for eventual consistency
- **State Pattern** with atomic state transitions

**Implementation Challenge:**
```java
public class ConcurrentCustomerService {
    // Handle concurrent customer profile updates
    public void updateCustomerProfile(String customerId, ProfileUpdate update) {
        // TODO: Ensure thread-safe updates
        // Consider: optimistic locking, event sourcing, command queuing
    }
    
    // Handle concurrent service activations
    public void activateService(String customerId, ServiceActivationRequest request) {
        // TODO: Prevent race conditions between service activations
        // Consider: state machine with atomic transitions
    }
}

// Design question: How would you handle these scenarios?
// 1. Two service activations for same customer at same time
// 2. Customer profile update while service activation in progress
// 3. Billing update concurrent with service modification
```

---

## Exercise 4: Pattern Selection Decision Framework üß†
**Pattern Focus:** Architectural Decision-Making | **Duration:** 25 minutes | **Type:** Analysis & Strategy

Creational      | [Criteria]  | [Anti-criteria] | [Size]    | [Level]    | [Real example]
Structural      | [Criteria]  | [Anti-criteria] | [Size]    | [Level]    | [Real example]
Behavioral      | [Criteria]  | [Anti-criteria] | [Size]    | [Level]    | [Real example]
```

#### Task 2: Anti-Pattern Recognition Guide (7 minutes)
Create guidelines for recognizing when patterns are being misused or over-applied.

**Anti-Pattern Categories:**
- **Over-Engineering:** Using complex patterns for simple problems
- **Pattern Obsession:** Forcing patterns where they don't fit
- **Wrong Pattern Selection:** Using patterns that don't match the problem
- **Pattern Mixing Issues:** Combining patterns that conflict

**For each anti-pattern, define:**
- **Recognition Signs:** How to spot the anti-pattern
- **Consequences:** What problems it causes
- **Refactoring Strategy:** How to fix it
- **Prevention:** How to avoid it in future

### Part B: Team Guidelines Development (10 minutes)

#### Task 1: Pattern Introduction Strategy (5 minutes)
Design a strategy for introducing new patterns to development teams.

**Strategy Components:**
```java
// Pattern Introduction Checklist
public class PatternIntroductionStrategy {
    
    // Step 1: Problem Analysis
    public PatternRecommendation analyzeNeed(ProjectContext context) {
        // TODO: Define how to assess if pattern is needed
        // Consider: code complexity, change frequency, team experience
    }
    
    // Step 2: Pattern Selection
    public SelectedPattern choosePattern(PatternRecommendation recommendation) {
        // TODO: Define pattern selection process

    }
    
    // Step 3: Implementation Planning
    public ImplementationPlan createPlan(SelectedPattern pattern) {
        // TODO: Define implementation approach
        // Consider: training needs, rollout strategy, success metrics
    }
    
    // Step 4: Success Measurement
    public SuccessMetrics defineMetrics(ImplementationPlan plan) {
        // TODO: Define how to measure pattern success
        // Consider: code quality, maintainability, team productivity
    }
}
```

#### Task 2: Pattern Review Process (5 minutes)
