# Design Patterns Workshop - Hands-On Exercises

## Overview

This directory contains practical, hands-on exercises designed to complement the Design Patterns training modules. Each exercise builds upon real-world Telekom scenarios and progressively increases in complexity across the 4-day workshop.

## Exercise Structure

### Day 1: Creational Patterns - Foundation Building
**Focus:** Code smell identification and basic pattern application
- **Duration:** 4 exercises, 15-30 minutes each
- **Skills:** Pattern recognition, refactoring fundamentals, SOLID principles
- **Context:** Customer service and contract management systems

### Day 2: Structural Patterns - System Integration  
**Focus:** Complex system composition and integration challenges
- **Duration:** 4 exercises, 20-30 minutes each
- **Skills:** System decomposition, interface design, architectural thinking
- **Context:** Service orchestration and legacy system integration

### Day 3: Behavioral Patterns - Process Optimization
**Focus:** Workflow management and dynamic behavior handling
- **Duration:** 4 exercises, 25-35 minutes each  
- **Skills:** Algorithm encapsulation, responsibility distribution, event handling
- **Context:** Network management and automated processes

### Day 4: Advanced Integration - Enterprise Architecture
**Focus:** Multi-pattern solutions and architectural design
- **Duration:** 3 exercises, 30-45 minutes each
- **Skills:** Pattern combination, system design, architectural decision-making
- **Context:** Enterprise platform integration and complex business workflows

## Exercise Types

### üîç **Code Analysis Exercises**
Identify patterns, anti-patterns, and code smells in existing implementations

### üõ†Ô∏è **Implementation Exercises** 
Build pattern-based solutions from scratch using provided requirements

### üîÑ **Refactoring Exercises**
Transform problematic code using appropriate design patterns

### üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Exercises**
