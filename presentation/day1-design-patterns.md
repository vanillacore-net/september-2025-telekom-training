# What Are Design Patterns?

## Definition
- Reusable solutions to common problems
- Proven approaches in software design
- Communication tool between developers
- Not code, but concepts and relationships
- Context-specific implementations

## Key Benefits
- Reduce development time
- Improve code quality
- Enable better communication
- Facilitate maintenance
- Promote best practices

**Speaker Notes:** Design patterns are like architectural blueprints - they provide a template for solving common problems but must be adapted to specific contexts. They're not magic solutions but proven approaches.

---

# Pattern Categories Overview

## Creational Patterns
- **Singleton** - Single instance control
- **Factory Method** - Object creation delegation
- Abstract Factory - Product families
- Builder - Complex object construction
- Prototype - Object cloning

## Structural Patterns
- Adapter - Interface compatibility
- Decorator - Dynamic behavior extension
- Facade - Simplified interfaces
- Composite - Tree structures
- Proxy - Object representatives

**Speaker Notes:** Today we focus on Creational patterns, specifically Singleton and Factory Method. These are fundamental patterns that appear in most enterprise applications.

# When to Use Patterns

## Good Reasons
- Solving recurring design problems
- Improving code communication
- Building flexible architectures
- Following team standards
- Learning from proven solutions

## Warning Signs
- Pattern for pattern's sake
- Over-engineering simple solutions
- Forcing patterns where unnecessary
- Ignoring performance implications
- Missing the problem context

**Speaker Notes:** Patterns should solve real problems, not create complexity. Always ask "what problem am I solving?" before applying a pattern.

# Singleton Pattern Introduction

## Purpose
Ensure a class has only one instance and provide global access to it

## Use Cases
- Database connections
- Logging services
- Configuration managers
- Cache implementations
- Resource managers

## Key Characteristics
- Private constructor
- Static instance variable
- Static getInstance() method
- Thread-safe implementation
- Lazy or eager initialization

**Speaker Notes:** Singleton is one of the most recognized patterns but also controversial. We'll explore both proper usage and common pitfalls.

---

# Singleton Implementation - Basic

```javascript
// Basic Singleton Pattern
class Logger {
  static instance = null;
  
  constructor() {
    if (Logger.instance) {
      return Logger.instance;
    }
    
    this.logs = [];
    Logger.instance = this;
  }
  
  static getInstance() {
    if (!this.instance) {
      this.instance = new Logger();
    }
    return this.instance;
  }
  
  log(message) {
    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
    this.logs.push(`${timestamp}: ${message}`);
  }
  
  getLogs() {
    return [...this.logs];
  }
}
```

**Speaker Notes:** This basic implementation shows the core concept. Notice the static instance, getInstance method, and constructor logic that prevents multiple instances.

---

# Singleton Implementation - Thread Safe

```javascript
// Thread-Safe Singleton with Lazy Loading
class DatabaseConnection {
  static instance = null;
  static isCreating = false;
  
  constructor() {
    if (DatabaseConnection.instance) {
      return DatabaseConnection.instance;
    }
    
    if (DatabaseConnection.isCreating) {
      throw new Error('Singleton creation in progress');
    }
    
    DatabaseConnection.isCreating = true;
    this.connectionString = '';
    this.isConnected = false;
    DatabaseConnection.instance = this;
    DatabaseConnection.isCreating = false;
  }
  
  static getInstance() {
    if (!this.instance && !this.isCreating) {
      this.instance = new DatabaseConnection();
    }
    return this.instance;
  }
  
  connect(connectionString) {
    if (!this.isConnected) {
      this.connectionString = connectionString;
      this.isConnected = true;
      console.log('Database connected');
    }
  }
}
```

**Speaker Notes:** In enterprise applications, thread safety is crucial. This implementation prevents race conditions during instance creation.

# Singleton - Enterprise Example

```javascript
// Configuration Manager Singleton
class ConfigurationManager {
  static instance = null;
  
  constructor() {
    if (ConfigurationManager.instance) {
      return ConfigurationManager.instance;
    }
    
    this.config = {};
    this.loaded = false;
    ConfigurationManager.instance = this;
  }
  
  static getInstance() {
    if (!this.instance) {
      this.instance = new ConfigurationManager();
    }
    return this.instance;
  }
  
  async loadConfiguration(source) {
    if (!this.loaded) {
      // Simulate loading from external source
      this.config = await this.fetchConfig(source);
      this.loaded = true;
    }
  }
  
  getProperty(key, defaultValue = null) {
    return this.config[key] ?? defaultValue;
  }
  
  async fetchConfig(source) {
    // Simulate async config loading
    return {
      apiUrl: 'https://api.telekom.com',
      timeout: 5000,
      retryAttempts: 3
    };
  }
}
```

**Speaker Notes:** This example shows a realistic enterprise use case. Configuration is loaded once and shared across the application.

# Factory Method Pattern Introduction

## Purpose
Create objects without specifying exact classes, delegating creation to subclasses

## Use Cases
- Creating UI components
- Database driver selection
- Logger implementations
- Plugin architectures
- Service instantiation

## Key Benefits
- Loose coupling between creator and product
- Easy extension with new products
- Single responsibility principle
- Open/closed principle compliance

**Speaker Notes:** Factory Method promotes flexibility by removing direct class dependencies. Clients work with abstractions rather than concrete classes.

---

# Factory Method - Basic Structure

```javascript
// Product Interface
class PaymentProcessor {
  processPayment(amount) {
    throw new Error('Must implement processPayment method');
  }
}

// Concrete Products
class CreditCardProcessor extends PaymentProcessor {
  processPayment(amount) {
    return `Processing $${amount} via Credit Card`;
  }
}

class PayPalProcessor extends PaymentProcessor {
  processPayment(amount) {
    return `Processing $${amount} via PayPal`;
  }
}

class BankTransferProcessor extends PaymentProcessor {
  processPayment(amount) {
    return `Processing $${amount} via Bank Transfer`;
  }
}
```

**Speaker Notes:** Notice the abstract base class defining the interface. Concrete implementations provide specific behavior while maintaining the same interface.

---

# Factory Method - Implementation

```javascript
// Factory Method Implementation
class PaymentProcessorFactory {
  static createProcessor(type, config = {}) {
    switch(type) {
      case 'creditcard':
        return new CreditCardProcessor(config);
      case 'paypal':
        return new PayPalProcessor(config);
      case 'banktransfer':
        return new BankTransferProcessor(config);
      default:
        throw new Error(`Unknown payment processor: ${type}`);
    }
  }
  
  static getSupportedProcessors() {
    return ['creditcard', 'paypal', 'banktransfer'];
  }
  
  static createFromConfig(configObject) {
    const { type, settings } = configObject;
    return this.createProcessor(type, settings);
  }
}

// Usage
const processor = PaymentProcessorFactory.createProcessor('creditcard');
const result = processor.processPayment(100.00);
console.log(result); // "Processing $100 via Credit Card"
```

**Speaker Notes:** The factory encapsulates creation logic and can easily be extended. Notice how clients don't need to know about specific processor classes.

# Factory Method - Enterprise Example

```javascript
// Enterprise Service Factory
class ServiceFactory {
  static services = new Map();
  
  static registerService(name, serviceClass) {
    this.services.set(name, serviceClass);
  }
  
  static createService(name, config = {}) {
    const ServiceClass = this.services.get(name);
    
    if (!ServiceClass) {
      throw new Error(`Service '${name}' not registered`);
    }
    
    return new ServiceClass(config);
  }
  
  static createFromEnvironment(environmentConfig) {
    const services = {};
    
    for (const [name, config] of Object.entries(environmentConfig)) {
      try {
        services[name] = this.createService(name, config);
      } catch (error) {
        console.warn(`Failed to create service ${name}: ${error.message}`);
      }
    }
    
    return services;
  }
}

// Register services
ServiceFactory.registerService('logger', ConsoleLogger);
ServiceFactory.registerService('database', PostgreSQLConnection);
ServiceFactory.registerService('cache', RedisCache);
```

**Speaker Notes:** This enterprise example shows how factories enable plugin architectures and configuration-driven service creation.
