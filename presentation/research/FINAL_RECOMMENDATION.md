## EXECUTIVE DECISION

### 🏆 WINNER: Slidev (Vue-based)

**Slidev solves ALL the layout problems that make Marp unusable.**

### Key Evidence

**❌ MARP IS BROKEN**:
- CSS classes in markdown don't work: `<!-- _class: two-columns -->`
- Requires ugly HTML mixing: `<div class="columns-container">`
- Cannot create professional two-column or half-picture layouts
- Layout system fundamentally flawed

**✅ SLIDEV WORKS PERFECTLY**:
- Clean markdown: `layout: two-cols` 
- No HTML required for any layout
- Professional output immediately
- Modern tech stack (Vue 3, Vite)

### Live Proof

**Working Demos**:
- **Slidev**: http://localhost:3001 ✅ Perfect layouts
- **reveal-md**: http://localhost:3002 ✅ Good alternative

**Comparison**:
```markdown
# MARP (BROKEN)
<!-- _class: two-columns --> <!-- DOESN'T WORK -->
<div class="columns-container">  <!-- UGLY HTML REQUIRED -->
  <div class="column">Content</div>
  <div class="column">Content</div>
</div>

# SLIDEV (WORKS)  
---
layout: two-cols                 <!-- CLEAN YAML -->
---
# Title

::default::                      <!-- CLEAN TEMPLATE -->
Content left

::right::                        <!-- CLEAN TEMPLATE -->
Content right
```
