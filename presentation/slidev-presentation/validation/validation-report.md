## Date: 2025-09-08

## Screenshots Taken
- Slide 1: Title slide - FIXED & RE-VALIDATED ✅
- Slide 2: Section slide - VALIDATED ✅  
- Slide 3: Single column content - VALIDATED ✅
- Slide 4: Two-column layout - VALIDATED ✅
- Slide 5: Image-right layout - VALIDATED ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Two-Column Layout (Slide 4)
- **Problem**: Layout was completely broken, showing only headers without bullet points
- **Cause**: Incorrect slot syntax for Slidev (was using Vue template slots incorrectly)
- **Solution**: Changed to simple grid layout using `<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">`
- **Status**: FIXED ✅

### 2. Font Sizes (Previously Fixed)
- Changed from viewport units (vw) to fixed rem units
- h1: 2rem (was 2.8vw)
- p: 1rem (was 1.9vw)
- Status: WORKING ✅

### 3. Logo Position (Previously Fixed)  
- Corner logo now at top: 20px, right: 30px
- Size: 60px (was 8vh)
- Status: WORKING ✅

### 4. Open Sans Font (Previously Fixed)
- Google Fonts imported
- Applied throughout presentation
- Status: WORKING ✅

### 5. Title Slide Text Cut-off (Latest Fix)
- **Problem**: Title slide text was cut off at bottom, subtitle not visible
- **Cause**: Container height too restrictive (70vh)
- **Solution**: Increased to min-height: 90vh with proper padding
- **Font sizes**: Adjusted to 2rem for h1, 1.3rem for h2
- **Status**: FIXED ✅

## Current Status

✅ Image-right layout

### Notes

## Conclusion
The Slidev presentation now correctly matches the original RevealJS design with:
- Proper Open Sans typography
