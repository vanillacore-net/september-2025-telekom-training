# CRITICAL PRESENTATION ISSUES - SYSTEMATIC FIXES REQUIRED

## 1. FRAGMENT REVEALS COMPLETELY BROKEN
- List items with fragments DON'T separate anymore
- Content visible from start when it should be hidden
- Fragments WITHIN text not working properly
- Need to ensure EACH fragment has unique sequential index PER SLIDE

## 2. CODE BLOCK ISSUES
- Font size STILL WAY TOO LARGE (0.8em still too big - needs 0.6em or smaller)
- Code blocks only using 50% of available screen real estate
- Width constrained to 88% when should be near 100%
- Need proper responsive sizing

## 3. MISSING/BROKEN CONTENT
- Headlines like "Factory Method Pattern Problem" not rendering as headlines
- Missing content between problem statements and code
- Slides with NO content at all
- Content that belongs together split across slides

## 4. STRUCTURAL ISSUES
- Problem statements without showing problematic code
- Content flow completely broken
- Slides not self-contained
- Missing visual hierarchy

## 5. CSS/STYLING DISASTERS
- Text cutoff issues
- Fragment visibility broken
- Code block containment broken
- Overall layout destroyed

## SYSTEMATIC APPROACH REQUIRED:
1. Fix fragment indexing globally
2. Fix code block sizing to use full width
3. Reduce code font to 0.6em or smaller
4. Ensure all content is present and properly structured
5. Fix heading hierarchy
6. Validate EVERY slide renders correctly
7. Test fragment reveals work progressively
